## Features

- Google web and image search.
- Keyword/user logger and notifier. Get notified when keywords you specified are said in any of your server or follow users and get notified when they send a message (with a cooldown). Useful to track someone or see if someone mentioned your name or your favorite show/book/whatever else keywords and you want to stalkâ€” I mean, talk to them about it.
- Set your game/stream to anything or set up multiple and cycle through them.
- Cycle through avatars automatically.
- Save image/gif/webm dumps (urls or attachments) in channels quickly to your computer (checks for duplicates as well).
- Detailed image/gif source finder using sauce.nao
- Add custom commands/reactions. The commands get saved to ``commands.json`` which has some sample commands added to start with. Can be used as macros for other commands as well.
- Custom embeds.
- Todo list with notifications and a timer (repeatable) as well as ability to send a message to a channel when the timer goes off.
- Smart MyAnimeList search of anime and manga/LNs using google custom search (and if that fails, using myanimelist's api for search)
- Save/output the last n number of messages from a chat, including any messages that were deleted.
- Get detailed information about a server and all of its members.
- Purge the last n messages you sent in a channel.
- Simple calculator.
- Quick commands so you can post pointless stuff as fast as possible like ``lenny``, ``shrug``, ``flip``, ``unflip``, and ``comeatmebro``
- Meme commands like spacing text, converting text to regional indicator emojis, mass reacting to messages, and converting text to ascii art.
- Python interpreter. Modeled off of RoboDanny's ?debug command. Does both exec() and eval(). Ability to save and load scripts.
- Various other misc commands like spoiler tagging text (encrypts the text), creating strawpolls, embeding text, server/user info commands, and more.print('imuowhjmie')
